# Benchmark and Model Zoo

## Mirror sites

We use AWS as the main site to host our model zoo, and maintain a mirror on aliyun.
You can replace `https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/open-mmlab` with `https://open-mmlab.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com` in model urls.

## Common settings

- All FPN baselines and RPN-C4 baselines were trained using 8 GPU with a batch size of 16 (2 images per GPU). Other C4 baselines were trained using 8 GPU with a batch size of 8 (1 image per GPU).
- All models were trained on `coco_2017_train`, and tested on the `coco_2017_val`.
- We use distributed training and BN layer stats are fixed.
- We adopt the same training schedules as Detectron. 1x indicates 12 epochs and 2x indicates 24 epochs, which corresponds to slightly less iterations than Detectron and the difference can be ignored.
- All pytorch-style pretrained backbones on ImageNet are from PyTorch model zoo.
- For fair comparison with other codebases, we report the GPU memory as the maximum value of `torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()` for all 8 GPUs. Note that this value is usually less than what `nvidia-smi` shows.
- We report the inference time as the overall time including data loading, network forwarding and post processing.


## Baselines

### Training Speed

The training speed is measure with s/iter. The lower, the better.

    <td>0.200</td>
    <td>0.205</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### Inference Speed

The inference speed is measured with fps (img/s) on a single GPU, the higher, the better.
To be consistent with Detectron2, we report the pure inference speed (without the time of data loading).
For Mask R-CNN, we exclude the time of RLE encoding in post-processing.
The speed in the brackets of detectron2 is tested using our own server, which is slightly slower than the official speed.
